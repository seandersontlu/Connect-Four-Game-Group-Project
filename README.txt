What is this?
------------

These are classes that will build a Connect Four game for two players. Each
player will be assigned a color. The two colors are Red and Yellow. Red will
always start first and the programs we have wrote will check if a player has
connected four of their tokens together whether it be vertical, horizontal, or
diagonal. Once a player wins, they will have the option to reset the board and
also the scores will be kept track of. We have created a Player class and Board
class (which will run the game and create the board).
