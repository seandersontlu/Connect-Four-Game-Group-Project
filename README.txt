What is this?
------------

These are classes that will build a Connect Four game for two players. Each
player will be assigned a color. The two colors are Red and Yellow. Yellow will
always start first and the programs we have wrote will check if a player has
connected four of their tokens together whether it be vertical, horizontal, or
diagonal. Once a player wins, they will have the option to reset the board and
also the scores will be kept track of. We have created a Player class and Board
class (which will run the game and create the board).

GUI
---
The users must run the GUI on the same computer in order to play the game.
Player 1 will enter their name, and their screen will come up. Before they can start
playing, player 2 must join the game and enter their information. Once player 2 has 
joined they may both begin playing the game until either one of them has won or one
of them has pressed the quit button.
